Interfaces from PHP Framework Interop Group
===========================================

PHP-FIG provides useful standards recommendations for PHP developers.

Some of those recommendations include interfaces that web application
developers can implement.

For more information on PHP-FIG please see their website:

[https://www.php-fig.org]

The interfaces here are taken from their repository on github:

[https://github.com/php-fig]

Only the interfaces themselves and the license files are in this collection.

This collection exists solely to make it possible for classes used in WordPress
via the PSR-4 autoloader by Alice Wonder Miscreations to implement these
interfaces in a way that the autoloader can readily find and load then as
needed.

Alice Wonder Miscreations is not a member of PHP-FIG. Please visit their
